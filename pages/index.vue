              Neighbors can ask a deposit when lending an item. The deposits are stored safely on the Hedera network and are returned
              automatically when the item is returned to its owner. We also encourage reviewing and we make sure the reviews are reliable by
              storing them on the Hedera network.

                <h4>Market research</h4>

                <p>
                  What motivates people to share items? And how do they feel about deposits? I conduced a small
                  <a href="/pilot-survey.pdf" class="border-bottom">pilot study</a> (in Dutch) and readjusted my design decisions
                  accordingly. Due to time constraints, I only collected a small amount of responses. I'm planning to launch a bigger study
                  in a later stage.

                <h4>Design and development</h4>

                <p>
                  I designed and developed the majority of the dApp, including the homepage, the app page and the search functionality. I
                  mainly used bootstrap with SCSS, Vue and Nuxt.

                <h4>Locations and distances</h4>

                <p>
                  I integrated a map using the Google Maps Javascript API to make it easier for users to find items in their own
                  neighborhood. I also used the
                  <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geometry">Google's Geometry Library</a> for computing
                  distances between users.

                  <p>
                    I developed a decentralized storage solution for the data on the Hedera testnet. While this has some obvious
                    disadvantages in terms of speed, it also eliminated the need for back-end development whilst also providing the
                    opportunity to get more experience with writing smart contracts on Hedera. In a later stage I will switch to a more
                    scalable, and possibly centralized, approach.

                  <p>
                    I created a dataset with dummy data, using items from my own and my families' household. Addionally, I created a set of
                    dummy user accounts including a wallet for each dummy user on the Hedera testnet.

                  My boyfriend tested the whole application and I changed and fixed a lot stuff based on his feedback. Unfortunately, I was
                  unable to solve all issues before the deadline. Remaining issues will be fixed after the judging phase.

                  I want to convert Heather to a multi-language website, such that I can also create a Dutch version and launch the first

                  The current decentralized solution for storing data is too slow and not scalable. Therefore I need to develop a different
                  back-end that is faster, easier to interact with and that can handle larger datasets.

                  People who do not have a Hedera wallet should also be able to use Heather. Therefore, I want to integrate an onRamping
