          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Heather is a platform that facilitates borrowing and lending items among neighbors and local communities. It operates as a
            peer-to-peer sharing platform, allowing individuals to share various items they own with others in their vicinity. The idea
            behind Heather is to promote sustainability, reduce waste, and foster a sense of community by encouraging people to borrow
            things they need rather than purchasing them outright.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Heather, users can list items they own but are not currently using, such as tools, electronics, kitchen appliances, camping
            gear, and much more. When someone needs to borrow an item, they can search for it on Heather's platform and connect with nearby
            individuals who have the item available for lending. The borrower can send a request, and if the owner agrees, they can arrange
            the details of the borrowing process, including pickup and return.
          </p>
          <p>
            By utilizing Heather, people can save money, reduce consumption, and minimize their environmental impact by sharing resources
            within their local community. It promotes a circular economy and encourages a sense of trust and connection among neighbors who
            participate in the sharing process.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>
            Our society continues to struggle with a pervasive culture of overconsumption, leading to rampant materialism, unnecessary
            purchases, and the subsequent strain on resources, contributing to rising waste levels, carbon emissions, and a worsening
            ecological footprint. But at the same time, due to urbanisation, storage space at home is limited, making it increasingly
            difficult to accommodate infrequently used items or manage bulky belongings. Whilst urban areas become more densely populated,
            social cohesion within neighborhoods declines rapidly, which makes it increasingly difficult to borrow items from neighbors.
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s still hope. Our small pilot study conducted in The Netherlands revealed that people also care about minimizing their
            environmental impact, getting to know their neighbors and saving money by borrowing or renting items from their neighbors.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, current solutions for sharing resources and improving social cohesion, such as Peerby and Nextdoor struggle with trust
            and security concerns. For example, when an item lended on Peerby gets damaged, you may get a refund from Peerby. However, this
            may take a lot of time and also requires Peerby to have a paid subscription model.

          <h2>Problem statement</h2>

          <p>
            <i
              >How can we stimulate people to share resources within their local community instead of buying items and not sharing anything
              with their neighbors?</i
            >
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Solving the problem</h2>

          <p>
            Unlike Peerby, Heather provides a secure sharing platform using smart contract technology on the Hedera network. Users can ask a
            deposit for each item they share. The deposit is stored in the smart contract whenever someone starts borrowing an item. When
            the owner of the item reports a problem, the borrower loses his deposit and the owner receives the deposit as a compensation for
            their damaged or missing item.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thanks to Hedera’s secure and fast network with low transaction fees, we were able to create a fully decentralized platform for
            sharing resources within local communities to minimize environmental impact and to increase social cohesion.
